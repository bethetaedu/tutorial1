{"name":"Tutorial","tagline":"tutorial","body":"### Server Offloading\r\nRIGHT supports server offloading using Shiny package. For example, when RIGHT users want to make a regression, the client side just send nodes information to the server side. After the server side do complicated calculation on R, it sends only result back to the client side. From this server offloading, even though the client side which has no R environment could do complex calculation quickly.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe RIGHT package depends on the Shiny packages, so we have to install this first, e.g. in R via:\r\n```R\r\n> install.packages('Shiny')\r\n```\r\nTo run shiny type :\r\n```R\r\n> library(shiny)\r\n> setwd(\"YOUR PATH\")\r\n> runApp(\"YOUR FOLDER NAME\")\r\n```\r\nNow, type the code you want to run :\r\n```R\r\n> RIGHT( \r\n  YOUR CODE\r\n)\r\n```\r\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
