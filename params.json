You just need to wrap R-basic syntax with RIGHT bracket.\r\n\r\nFor example, in original R, you can draw basic scatter grpahs like below.\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> plot(price ~ carat, diamonds, type=\"p\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it will show like below graph.\r\n![](http://thepotter.woobi.co.kr/img/scatter_R.PNG)\r\n![](http://thepotter.woobi.co.kr/img/scatter_R.PNG)\r\n \r\nNow, what you need to get our RIGHT graph is just wrapping with RIGHT bracket.\r\n```R\r\n> RIGHT(plot(price ~ carat, diamonds, type=\"p\"))\r\n```\r\nFinally you can get the exactly same graph, but beautiful and interactive one, on your default browser!\r\n\r\n![](http://thepotter.woobi.co.kr/img/scatter_diamonds.PNG)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
